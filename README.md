Using the pandas DataFrame. I stared using the default CSV package that comes with Python but that got really dumb really fast. 

I was able to distill my original from 50 + lines down to 30+. Also it is easier to read with Pandas. 

This is a quick script to add an additional column to a TSV file that was imported from Fluentcards.com which is a website that translates words from a Kindle Vocabulary Builder database to an Anki flashcard deck. 

I then import the modified file into my ANKI deck to study. 

Originally I was doing this process manually but I knew that I could automate.
